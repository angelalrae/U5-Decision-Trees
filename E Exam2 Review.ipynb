    "## What to Bring?\n",
    "* Two sharp pencils and a good eraser\n",
    "* Data mining and Python programming knowledge in your head :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What NOT to Bring?\n",
    "* Electronics (including calculators) may not be used during the exam!\n",
    "* Notes may not be used during the exam!\n",
    "    * You may use your RQ note cards if you turned them in\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you are caught cheating, your exam will be confiscated and you will receive a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Use the restroom before class. Once testing starts, the only reason for leaving the classroom is turning in your exam as done.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam Format\n",
    "The exam will be closed-book, closed-notes (except for RQ notecards), and closed-friends. The exam format is paper pencil and it will have a mix of concept questions and programming questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam Time Frame\n",
    "Please be aware that, because you will be taking the exam during a normal lecture period (50 minutes), time will be extremely tight for the exam so work efficiently and manage your time well. If you show up late to class, you will have less time to take the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam Coverage\n",
